## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Development workflow

### What I learned

For this challenge I focussed on getting the solution out as quick as possible using Sass with BEM, SMACSS principles
and no JS. I still used the Vite tools for my development workflow and this works very well for 
spinning up a dev environment and getting into the coding loop

I did take time before starting to identify what parts of the page can be split into components and how to approach layout.

Even though this is a small project which took a couple of hours - I stuck with the process instead of using a single CSS file.
This decision was purely for me to practice what I learned about code structure and Sass from last week.

### Continued development

I will be applying the principles learned from SMACSS to CSS code architecture going forward - Also I will focus more
on structuring HTML using semantic markup and learn more about what modern HTML elements can be used that provide more
meaning to the underlying document elements.

BEM is definitely a keeper and I will continue using BEM for future projects - my opinion is that it's a great tool for
decoupling CSS from HTML.

I plan to continue using Vite and React and developing my skills in that area.

## Acknowledgments

[Jonathan Snook](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/smacss/) - Thanks for presenting the workshop at Frontend Masters,
this workshop has inspired me to treat CSS as a legitimate coding language and to take a more engineering-centric approach
to structuring and authoring CSS.

[Mike North](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sass/) - Thanks for delivering the 'Frontend Masters Sass Fundamentals' course
, this course gave me enough base knowledge to implement functions, mixins and nest the Scss code appropriately.
